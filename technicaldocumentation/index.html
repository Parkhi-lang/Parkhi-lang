          C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language. This language allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications and software development, game development, and operating system programming. It is an expansion of the C programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is used to develop programs for computers. 
        </p>
        <p>C++ is a most popular cross-platform programming language which is used to create high-performance applications and software like OS, Games, E-commerce software, etc. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension of C language. C++ give a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>

        <p>
        C++ comes with libraries that provide us with many ways for performing input and output. In C++ input and output are performed in the form of a sequence of bytes or more commonly known as streams.
        <ul class="inputdes">
          <li><b>Input Stream:</b> If the direction of flow of bytes is from the device(for example, Keyboard) to the main memory then this process is called input.
</li>
          <li><b>Output Stream:</b> If the direction of flow of bytes is opposite, i.e. from main memory to device( display screen ) then this process is called output.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <header>Iterators</header>
        <p>In Programming, sometimes there is a need to perform some operation more than once or (say) n number of times. Loops come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. 

For example: Suppose we want to print “Hello World” 10 times.</p> 
<p>
 <b>This can be done in two ways as shown below:</b> 
  <ol>
    <li><b>Entry Controlled loops:</b> In this type of loop, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and While Loop is entry-controlled loops.

</li>
    <li><b>Exit Controlled Loops:</b> In this type of loop the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. Therefore, the loop body will execute at least once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. the do-while loop is exit controlled loop.</li>
  </ol>

      <section class="main-section" id="Conditionals">
        <header>Conditionals</header>
        <p>Decision-making in C++ helps to write decision-driven statements and execute a particular set of code based on certain conditions.

The C++ if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not executed based on a certain type of condition.</p>
<div class="code">
  <code>
    #include < iostream ><br>
using namespace std;<br>
    
int main()<br> 
{  
    int i = 10;<br> 
    
    if (i < 15) { <br> 
        cout << "10 is less than 15 \n";<br>  
    } <br> 
    
    cout << "I am Not in if";  <br>
}
  </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it won’t. But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the C++ else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      #include < iostream > <br>
using namespace std; <br> 
    
int main()  <br>
{  
    int i = 20;<br>  
    
    // Check if i is 10 <br> 
    if (i == 10)  <br>
        cout << "i is 10";<br>  
    
    // Since is not 10  <br>
    // Then execute the else statement <br> 
    else<br>
        cout << "i is 20\n"; <br> 
    
    cout << "Outside if-else block"; <br> 
    
    return 0;  <br>
}  <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    In C++, the if-else-if ladder helps the user decide from among multiple options. The C++ if statements are executed from the top down. As soon as one of the conditions controlling the if is true, the statement associated with that if is executed, and the rest of the C++ else-if ladder is bypassed. If none of the conditions is true, then the final statement will be executed.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
      <code>
        #include < iostream > <br> 
using namespace std; <br>

    int i = 20; <br>

  <header>Function Declaration</header>
        <p>
          A function is a set of statements that takes input, does some specific computation, and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together to make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call this function.
In simple terms, a function is a block of code that runs only when it is called.
          </p>

            <code>

        <header>OOPs</header>
        <p>Object-oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
<br>
There are some basic concepts that act as the building blocks of OOPs i.e.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Class
</li>
  <li>Objects</li>
  <li>Encapsulation</li>
  <li>Abstraction</li>
  <li>Inheritance</li>
  <li>Dynamic Binding</li>
  <li>Message Passing</li>
  
  </ol>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Classes_and_Objects">
        <header>Classes and Objects</header>
        <p>
          The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object. For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, the Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, and mileage are their properties. </p>
          <ul class="inputdes">
            <li>A Class is a user-defined data type that has data members and member functions.

</li>
            <li>Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables together these data members and member functions define the properties and behavior of the objects in a Class.</li>
            <li>In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage, etc and member functions can apply brakes, increase speed, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              An <em>Object</em> is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

      <section class="main-section" id="Abstraction">
        <header>Abstraction</header>
        <p>Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.</p> 
<p>
Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of the car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes, etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">
        <header>Encapsulation</header>
        <p>Encapsulation in C++ is defined as the wrapping up of data and information in a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.</p>
<p>
Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section, etc. Now,</p>
<ul class="inputdes">
  <li>The finance section handles all the financial transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance.
</li>Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales.
    </li>
  </u>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Polymorphism">
        <header>Polymorphism</header>
        <p>The word “polymorphism” means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
        <p><b>TYPES OF POLYMORPHISM</b></p>
        <ul class="inputdes">
          <li>Compile-time Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Runtime Polymorphism</li>
          </ul>
      </section>

       <section class="main-section" id="Function-Overloading">
        <header>Function-Overloading</header>
        <p>Function overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters. When a function name is overloaded with different jobs it is called Function Overloading. In Function Overloading “Function” name should be the same and the arguments should be different. Function overloading can be considered as an example of a <a class="poly" href="#polymorphism">polymorphism</a> feature in C++.</p>
<p>
If multiple functions having same name but parameters of the functions should be different is known as Function Overloading.
If we have to perform only one operation and having same name of the functions increases the readability of the program.
Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be any number of arguments, if you write the function such as a(int,int) for two parameters, and b(int,int,int) for three parameters then it may be difficult for you to understand the behavior of the function because its name differs.

        <p>C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as operator overloading. Operator overloading is a compile-time polymorphism. For example, we can overload an operator ‘+’ in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +. Other example classes where arithmetic operators may be overloaded are Complex Numbers, Fractional Numbers, Big integers, etc.</p>
